=============

### Deploying
Here is a step by step example of how you can get this server up and running:

#### From Precompiled Package (recommended)
1. Head over to the latest release and grab the most suitable package for you. 
2. Run the file you've just downloaded. 
3. Done'n'done :saxophone::turtle:

#### Using The Source Code
You can download the latest code from `master` using the special button on this page.  
_**Caution**_: development version is unstable and may contain errors of any kind. To improve security and user experience, we **highly** recommend you not to use the source code directly, but instead grab a package from _Releases_ :smiley_cat:

#### Packet Manager
Coming later :zap:
